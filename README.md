# auto_dfu

**auto_dfu** is a macOS tool that automatically triggers DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode on Apple Silicon Macs using the private AppleHPM interface. It communicates directly with the Thunderbolt controller via I2C to send low-level USB-C VDM (Vendor Defined Message) commands.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This tool uses undocumented Apple interfaces and is intended for advanced users familiar with DFU procedures and macOS internals. Use at your own risk.

# auto_dfu

**auto_dfu** is a macOS tool that automatically triggers DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode on Apple Silicon/Intel T2 Macs using the private AppleHPM interface. It communicates directly with the Thunderbolt controller via I2C to send low-level USB-C VDM (Vendor Defined Message) commands.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This tool uses undocumented Apple interfaces and is intended for advanced users familiar with DFU procedures and macOS internals. Use at your own risk.

üôè Special thanks to macvdmtool for inspiration...and most of the code. :P
